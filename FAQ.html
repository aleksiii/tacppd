Q. What is tacppd?
A. tacppd - this is an open source software development project of
   AAA server dedicated to providing a robust, full-featured,
	 commercial-quality, industry platform for the Service Providers.
	 AAA server - this is server
   for remoute authenticate, authorize and account users on
   several types of network devices. I am working with
   Cisco devices, but i think, that some other devices can
   use tacppd too.

Q. What does it mean: tacppd? And why?
A. Tacppd - this is Tacacs Plus Plus Daemon
   I use this name, because it developed with C++.
   And it should be next step of tacacs+ protocol server implementation.

Q. Can tacppd works without root privileges?
A. Yes. You can start it from any user, but in this case you
   should use tcp/udp ports with numbers higher 1024.
   Also carefully check directories owners and it's rights.

Q. Can I use non-sql data source for store user information?
A. You need in appropriate database module. Tacppd doesn't
   use SQL queries, it uses internal structures and database module create
   SQL request from that information. But database module can
   use any data source.
	 If you don't have sql engine, you can use tacppd default database
	 source - xml-db module - it use text xml file for store data.
   For real use better to use SQL engine, we working mostly with PostgreSQL

Q. Can tacppd handle RADIUS requests?
A. No. But i wish to do it in future.

Q. Does tacppd support Oracle database?
A. Currently not. But in plans we will have it.

Q. I create config file, edit start script, it runs, but do not go in
   backgroung, and do not write any error or log
A. Looks like that you database module do not have access to shared
   database library. Write path to database lib (like /usr/local/pgsql/lib)
	 to your /etc/ld.so.conf file (for Linux), run 'ldconfig' and try again.

Q. How tacppd control availability of VoIP sessions
A. SNMP polling does not work for VoIP - and drop users via snmp not work too
   Instead use 'aaa update periodic' for tracking session activity
   and Cisco's IVR/TCL for this sessions control. See HowTo documents
	 for example of use tacppd for VoIP.

Q. During compiling file TacDb.cc doesn't compile and gcc dies
A. This is some optimyser problem with this file, so it require
   a lot of memory (gcc 3.x), or edit Makefile, remove -O2 keys
   and compile again. If you have enough memory, than you will not have
   this problem. Be ready, that with -O2 key this file will compile
   long time (several minutes on P4)

Q. I have some error after I do make install:

/usr/bin/ginstall: cannot stat `tacppd': No such file or directory
/usr/bin/ginstall: cannot stat `NOTES': No such file or directory
/usr/bin/ginstall: cannot stat `snmp/cisco-asy.so': No such file or directory
/usr/bin/ginstall: cannot stat `snmp/cisco-e1.so': No such file or directory
/usr/bin/ginstall: cannot stat `snmp/cisco-trf.so': No such file or directory

Also I adding some links
ln -s libnetsnmp.so libsnmp-0.4.2.1.so
ln -s /usr/lib/libcrypto.so /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.6

and  

/usr/src/tacppd/tacppd
Did not find  'InterfaceIndexOrZero' in module IF-MIB  
(/usr/local/share/snmp/mibs/HOST-RESOURCES-MIB.txt)

Segmantation fault

A. The libnetsnmp.so commonly linked to NET-SNMP lib version 5.
The version 4 of this library usually linked to libsnmp.so.
And it should have link to libsnmp.so if installed. Better to
try compile tacppd from sources, and get latest release
0.0.7pre4 from sourceforge. It has several critical fixes and
should correctly work with snmp library versions

Q. Support tacppd the new protocol for the wireless client auth like LEAP???
A. No. I do not have WLAN devices here and do not have experience in it.
If you with to have it into tacppd -  
please help, you can write some examples or something else and  
be a tester. I can try add it to tacppd in this case.

Q. Help... I have the program installed, I got it to write
the tables to my database, and now, I don't know how to
create the configurations using the program CLI.
A. The initial configuration you can do by use text editor end
edit etc/tacpp.conf file. Also you can use such method later,
but all changes will be applyed in tacppd restart. For
interactive way of configuration you can use CLI. If you have
created tables, when you can have access to tacppd CLI. Use
command "config" to go to configuration section. Use command
"show" for view current configuration. You can directly type
configuration commands in this mode. For example, if you wish
to do device 10.1.1.1 active, you can use next commands:
"device 10.1.1.1" to go to device configuration mode, and than
"no shutdown". The interface looks like Cisco CLI. For exit
from device configuration use "exit". Type "write" for store
configuration. You can use "?" for get help about available
commands.

Q. I'm getting a 'segmentation fault' error while a
authentication request from a Cisco router.
A. Looks like problems with database system. Did you create
database via CLI? In CLI telnet connection in "database" mode
command "create". Does it was successful? I will try add more
inormation in debug... Also add in tacpp.conf some additional
debug facilities: "facility tacacs" "facility database" and see
results in debug file.

Q. Do you guys plan to integrate this with an LDAP directory at some point?
A. Yes. But later.
