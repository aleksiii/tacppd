                      ------------------------------------
Maintained by Roman Volkov (rv at tacppd dot org)

20070903

develop, build and debug

20070810
rv - light cleans in CLI code (release 0.0.9)

20070731

i want to make this code more useful for any
Compile under FC7 (gcc 4.1.2)

20070211
rv - some cleanups in Tiep.cc (use MSG_NOSIGNAL during UDP operation
except signal processing by hands)
Compile under FC6 (gcc 4.1.1)

20061804
rv * thanks to mjl - fixed bug with mysql driver
also now compiled on FC4, several warnings fixed

20051103
rv * add two fields to netflow traffic table - "srcuser" and "dstuser" - 
and do checking across active users table for write actual usernames
into netflow traffic table if address is found into active users

20050721
rv * new API documentation now compiled with doxygen (doc/tacppd-api.tar.gz)

20050104
rv * some cleanups in XML config file

20041021

netflow users which we need in count traffic
* changes in web and billing utilities for current database names

20040801
rv

uncompatible with Solaris
*fix crash in some configs with wrong counting of Debug systems and
Device numbers, it was a bug which du crash during show configuration
if it was only one device or one debug into config 

20040607
rv1125
* move developing to gcc 3.4.0, so some fixes in code

    for test device availability

20020813
  - add icmp polling together with snmp polling - enabled by 'icmppolling'

20020802
  - fixes in tacacs+ authorization of Cisco VoIP gateways - it requests
    authorization start without any av-pairs inside, and we should
    responce to it...
  - add file debitcard.0.0.2.tcl to /contrib - this is example of VoIP gw
    TCL script for use with tacppd, with use tacacs+ authorization for
    sending available credit time amount to device with use
    'h323-credit-time=value' av-pair
  - i think to move documentation to html

    then information come, we can drop debug information and preserve only log
  - several cleanups in HTTP support core code

20020730
  - move test build to gcc 3.1.1
  - some fixes in Http.h/Http.cc in incorrect files handling from
    Dmitry Efimyuk

    strings in stress output)

20020722
  - prepare configure script for OCI and OCCI (Oracle Call Interface/Oracle C++ Call Interface)
    drivers support (drivers do not complete!)
  - some more correct errors messages handling in database code and database modules:

20020718
  - fixes with memory freeing in several places
    (reported and fixed by Dmitry Efimyuk)

Ok, i think, that feature list enough for version 0.0.5
now i freeze work for add new features and accept only bugfixes

20020702
  - fix with processing symbols ADCB in CLI
  - use username "DEFAULT" in authorization requests if no username available
  - several locks in Core objects
  - change 'open' and 'close' fieldnames to 'dopen' and 'dclose' due to some
    postgresql versions incompatibility (reported by Isk)

    errors in config file, by Dmitry Efimyuk.

20020622
  - config parser doesn't correct handle regular expression strings, fixed by Dmitry Efimyuk

  - fixed bug with incorrect daemonization (reported by Dmitry Efimyuk)
     problem: tacppd doesn't go to daemon mode, linux doesn't say anything, freebsd out
		 some about extra calls to free()
		 reason: wrong use of 'throw' call in Daemon.cc in daemon() function
		 fix: do not use 'throw' in daemon(), use _exit(0) instead
  - fixed bug with authorization information handling (reported by Igor Lyapin)
     problem: authorization code gets av-pairs from database where service=xxx and protocol=xxx av-pairs
		 doesn't match values requested from NAS
		 reason: Tacacs.cc file, TacacsServerAuthorization::process() code - no checks for service=xxx and
		 protocol=xxx av-pairs, wrong code without search in this av-pairs values in av-pairs adding code
		 fix: add several checks in av-pairs handling code, now looks like right, but require extra testing
  - various fixes and cleans in CLI database handling
  - database modules updates for possible use SELECT without WHERE statement, useful for
    CLI command 'show' for list all entries in table

20020619
  - first view database manipulation system via CLI but without check by open and close datetime
  - TacacsServerAuthorization::match_value wrong results, fixed by Igor Lyapin

    in case of format changes. The format version 1 while in development!
  - developing version 1 format of database tables - several changes

20020616
  - possible use libcipher instead libdes, set checking for <des.h> header and libcipher
    in configure scripts (thanks to Dmitriy Efimyuk)

20020614
  - add check in configure.in for use <sstream> or <strstream>
	 (prefer <sstream> if present), add flag -D_THREAD_SAFE for *freebsd
  - add check for processor type in configure.in, but this can create
    uncompatibility with very old gcc

20020606
