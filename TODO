- make messages/debug output to syslog if configured

!!! - redevelop database modules from use <list> to <map> for handle multiple
connections by number without search for needed connection - probably performance issue!!!

- redesign config parser/CLI. I think, that current handling is not
  optimal and buggy. So may be try to join several descriptions
  into one XML - CLI commands, Debug data and database tables/fields data
  and provide more clear parsing
- fix possibly security hole with AAA::cpass
- do collector for SNMP traps
- do internal SNMP server/agent for generate traps
  and for share several information to SNMP clients - mostly about current active users,
  it's IP and phones, about traffic counters on ip addresses or network devices ports,
  and also for drop users from ports.
  May be provide some utility and use snmpd which will call this utility.
- develop and implement TEP - "tacppd exchange protocol"
  protocol for communication between peer tacppd servers
  for rouming
- RADIUS support
- more enhancements in address pools code for automatic addresses grouping
- NetFlow information aggregator should be configurable
- how about handle HTTPS in http code? It will requre external cryptography library or something else.
- how about implement XML-RPC for interaction with http scripts?
- DIAMETER support
- GTP prime support

also we should have some set of standard testing tools - i mean tacacs+
stress tester, http stress tester, also we can try to do for example
some set of configuration changes and some collecting information from TCI.
