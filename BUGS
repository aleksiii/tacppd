#200306171844 - fixed now
sometime tacppd very fast eat all memory, looks like to
uncondicional cycle with memory occupation.
It can be after start, but can be after several days.
* problem was in use gethostbyname() function in multithread
environment. The situation can occures in unplanned manner.
ipaddr.h now uses thread safe call gethostbyname_r
I test this issue several days with debugger without problems.

#200307071502
some memory leak, i guess. It working some time, and in several
cases i see that it uses more and more memory. The memory using
is increase not fast and in some cases it doesn't visible.
- i guess, that this leak can occur into Tacacs.cc (tacacs+ code),
i just fixed it, but will test it, not shure.

#200307230847
problem with executing Perl files from http server if Perl compiled
with multithreading support (i think, not sure). Call run_perl()
freeze process and do not return output.
Perl library used: /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0/i686-linux-thread-multi/CORE/libperl.so

#200308151402
when tacppd working in bundle and new member add to bundle,
old member start occupy CPU resources. Possible bug with
bundle start packet processing.
